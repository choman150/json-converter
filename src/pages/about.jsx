            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">

                quickly transform data without installing any software.
            </p>

                Built with modern web technologies like React and Next.js, this tool is lightweight, responsive, and privacy-focused â€” no data is ever uploaded or stored on any server.

                Common use cases include importing/exporting data from admin dashboards, generating Excel reports from frontend apps, or converting deeply nested JSON from APIs into a more readable
                tabular format.
            </p>
