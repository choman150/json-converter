            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                This tool was created to simplify the conversion of structured data between CSV, Excel, and JSON formats. Whether you're a developer, data analyst, educator, or marketer, this tool
                enables quick transformations without needing to install any software.

                It was built using modern web technologies (React, Next.js) and is designed to be lightweight, responsive, and privacy-respecting â€” no data is ever uploaded to a server.

                Common users include those importing or exporting data from admin dashboards, generating Excel reports from frontend apps, or viewing deeply nested JSON results from APIs in a cleaner
                format.
